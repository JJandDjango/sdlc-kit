## 6. A worked example (greenfield)

```
mkdir billing-service && cd billing-service && git init
/cairn        → document why the project exists
/sdlc         → name: billing-service · adoption: greenfield · stack: python
/sdlc intake  → "Add invoice PDF export"
              → writes specs/invoice-pdf-export/contract.yaml, validates ready
# implement only what the contract scopes; CI re-validates every contract on push
/sdlc audit   → exit 0
```

Brownfield is the same flow on an existing repo — init skips whatever
already exists, and the first `intake` is where gate discipline
actually starts. 🟢 One step comes before it there: init's report names
the seat roster the repo needs, and intake stops until `intake-seat` is
ratified (kit 0.14.0).
