## 7. Restricted environments — the one-way membrane

> 🟢 **Shipped** (kit 0.10.0, [ADR 0023](../../decisions/0023-work-adoption-membrane.md)) —
> the policy, the findings form (`.sdlc/findings/TEMPLATE.yaml`), and
> the scaffold NOTICE (`.sdlc/NOTICE.md`).

Running the kit on code you cannot show outside (an employer, a
client) is a supported posture. Two facts make it safe by
construction:

- **The kit never phones home.** Every check is deterministic local
  Python — no network calls, no telemetry, no LLM anywhere in the
  enforcement path. The only network step is the pip install itself,
  pulling *from* public GitHub.
- **Flow is one-way.** The kit reaches your environment by public
  tag; nothing about your code travels back.

The discipline, one rule per direction:

| Direction | Rule |
|---|---|
| Kit → your repo | Install by pinned tag (`@vX.Y.Z`), never `main`. Upgrades are pull-only: re-pin, then `/sdlc update`. |
| Findings → upstream | File findings in controlled-dictionary terms, gate IDs, and counts — never code, never identifiers. The form at `.sdlc/findings/TEMPLATE.yaml` admits nothing else by construction. |
| Patches → upstream | Don't. Code written in your environment stays there; file a finding instead, and upstream re-implements the idea. |

**Mark your copy.** Every init renders `.sdlc/NOTICE.md` — upstream
URL, the rendering tag, the MIT license — so the vendored scaffold
reads as open source, not homegrown tooling, and the upgrade path
stays legible. Mirroring the whole kit inside your org? Copy that
file to the mirror root too.

**Local runs without managing Python.** CI needs nothing — hosted
runners ship Python, and the scaffolded workflow installs the kit
itself. For pre-push checks on a machine where you'd rather not
manage a Python install, `uv` (a single static binary, no Python
required to install it) runs the validator in an ephemeral
environment:

```bash
uv run --no-project --with "sdlc-taskcontract @ git+https://github.com/JJandDjango/sdlc-kit.git@v0.20.0" python -m taskcontract validate specs/<task-id>/contract.yaml --profile ready
```
